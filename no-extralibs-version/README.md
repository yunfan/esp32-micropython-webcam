This is a no extra libraries version for people who can not make upip work (like ordinary chinese people)

to use it, you should use the related firmware in the directory and change the wifi's ssid/password in `webcam.py`

then put boot.py and webcam.py to your esp32-cam

or you could use the webcam module alone with your own boot.py

if you want to save the LED life, please remove the led on/off code
